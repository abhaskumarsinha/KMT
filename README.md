A Keras-based motion transfer model leveraging first-order Jacobian-based motion estimation to animate a static image using keypoints, inspired by Aliaksandr Siarohin's first-order motion model.

## üìå About The Project
KMT: Keras Motion Transfer is a deep learning pipeline for animating a static image using the motion from a driving video. Inspired by recent advances in self-supervised keypoint-based motion transfer, this project implements a generative model in Keras that can transfer motion dynamics from video frames to a target image, generating a coherent, animated sequence.

KMT consists of two core components:

**Keypoint Detector**
- Detects keypoint positions and estimates local motion (via `2√ó2` Jacobians) in both the source (static image) and driving (video frame) domains.

**Generator**
- Takes a grayscale source image of shape `(256, 256, 1)` and the keypoint information from both the source and driving frames. It computes the transformation using first-order motion approximations and synthesizes the animated output frame-by-frame.

## üîç How It Works
- The keypoint detector extracts `(x, y)` coordinates and local Jacobians for each keypoint from both the source image and each frame of the driving video.

- Motion transfer is modeled based on a first-order approximation, as described in _Eq. `(4)`_ of the original motion transfer paper.

- The relative motion between keypoints is estimated using the Jacobians and keypoint offsets.

- A dense motion field is constructed, which is then fed into the generator along with the static source image.

- The generator synthesizes the animated frame corresponding to each video frame's motion.

- A GAN training setup refines both the keypoint detector and the generator for realistic motion and appearance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Highlights
- Built entirely using the Keras deep learning framework.

- Backend agnostic ‚Äî designed to work (in theory) with TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch backends.

- Grayscale only (B/W) generation to avoid misuse in real-world facial applications.

- Currently single-device only ‚Äî no support for distributed training yet.
